# undertow-spring 

This is a starter project that uses following technologies:

- Spring
- Spring-JDBC
- Undertow
- Hikari for mysql connection pooling
- GSON
- SLF4J with Logback 
- Jose4J
- Undertow

Purpose is the create a lightweight alternative to SpringBoot with fever dependencies
and faster bootup times. Undertow without MVC boots faster and have significant performance gains
when compared with classic springboot projects.  This project does use only most known annotations 
for Spring DI and for lombok when necessary. I do strongly believe annotations are making an application
hard to understand and debug.
